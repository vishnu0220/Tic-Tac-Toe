# Tic Tac Toe Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# Rules:
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. One player is "X" and the other player is "O". Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are full and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a draw.
# Gameplay:
Player 1 (X): Marks an empty square with an X.
Player 2 (O): Marks an empty square with an O.
Players continue to alternate turns until one wins or the game ends in a draw.
# Strategy:
1. Try to create a situation where you have two possible winning moves in your next turn.
2. Block your opponent’s attempts to create a row of three.
3. Take the center square when available, as it offers more potential winning combinations.
# Game Variants:
1. 3D Tic Tac Toe: Played on a 3×3×3 grid.
2. 4 in a Row: Played on a larger grid, typically 4×4, where the goal is to get four in a row.
Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that encourages strategic thinking and is enjoyable for players of all ages.
